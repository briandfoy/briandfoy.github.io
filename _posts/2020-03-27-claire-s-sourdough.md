Claire from Bon Appétit shows Brad how to make sourdough. She has a recipe in the [Times](https://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/59-how-to-make-sourdough-bread).

[ans744 on Reddit transcribed the recipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/comments/96a5wb/my_first_shot_its_alive_bon_appetit_recipe/).

There are some differences from what I was doing while following Sourdough U.

* She autolyzes with water at 90 F.

* She uses 20% starter by weight of flour. In 1000g flour, she uses 200g starter. I've been using 2%. That could explain a lack of rise. I was getting better rise when I wasn't measuring carefully and going overboard.

* After the stretch and fold, it's shaping and straight into the fridge. There's very little time for the gluten to lose its elasticity.
