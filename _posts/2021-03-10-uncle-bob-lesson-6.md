## All About Agile

Symptoms of mismanagement:

* delivering the wrong project
* project is inferior in quality
* late
* Iron Cross of project management (choose 3)
	* Good
	* Fast
	* Cheap
	* Done

* Data
	* Story points
	* Burn down chart
* Put the charts on the wall

* The purpose of Agile is to destroy hope
	* want to know how messed up we are as soon as we can

* Flacid scrum

* Small teams to do small things

* Project is not over when everything is done; it's over when there is nothing left doing.

* keep one task as a reference point for assigning story points
