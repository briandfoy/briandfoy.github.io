I have some laws of programming:

<!--more-->

**First Law** Make it so the program leaves you alone. If you have to constantly fiddle with your program, your program is a hobby not a time saver.

**Second Law** Make it so other people leave you alone. If other people have to keep interrupting you to make your programs work, you might as well do their work for them. But, you need to do your work and you don't have time to do their work. Computers are meant to save use time and labor.

**Third Law** Don't tell people how long it took. You're going to create some things very quicklyâ€”usually because the first thing you tried worked out or you know some trick. If you hand in your work right away, you may set up unreasonable expectations for the next time.
