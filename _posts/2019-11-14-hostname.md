title: Why are you rebooting?

I want to change the hostname on my Ubuntu-based MacBook Air. It's easy
to find advice and tips on almost anything by googling the question. I'm
use to the `hostname` command, but that only lasts the session. I can
change */etc/hostname*, but that file is used at startup. So much of the high google
juice content suggests a reboot, such as [this nixCraft](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ubuntu-change-hostname-command/).

Why does so much of the Ubuntu advice I find nowadays say to change
something then reboot?

I think there are two reasons.

First, much of the advice out there is clickbait crap. Look around enough and
you'll see the same content in different wrapper. That's just a low-paid person
copying whatever they found first then moving on to the next thing.  But, it
also shows up in some places where I expect more:

* [DigitalOcean fails to correct it](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-to-set-up-a-host-name-in-digitalocean) (and several other places).
* [The accepted answer](https://askubuntu.com/a/87687/912156) on AskUbuntu's question [How do I change the hostname without a restart?](https://askubuntu.com/q/87665/912156) says you have to restart.

A [less popular answer on AskUbuntu](https://askubuntu.com/a/516898/912156)
shows how to change it immediately and persist it through a reboot:

{% highlight text %}
$ hostnamectl set-hostname new-hostname
{% endhighlight %}

This is really the same as using `hostname` to set the session hostname,
but also putting that same value in */etc/hostname* so it's used on
the next startup.

Now, there is some merit to restarting: you can see if what you did
works across the restart. However, that's a different beast.
