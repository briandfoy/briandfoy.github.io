I'm trying to make a statistics joke about how I was almost a pro quarterback.

<!--more-->

So, the requirements, from general to specific

* Be Alive
* Be male
* Be in the America (no one plays it outside North America)
* Go to college
* Be selected by a pro team

So, if you look at all the people in world and filter to through this
sieve, I think I was probably statistically really close.

So, in rough numbers, I'm already in the top 5% by step three. Factor in
college and I'm so much closer.

* 100%: Population: 7,000,000,000 (World Bank: 7,125,000,000)
* 50%: Gender fraction: 3,500,000,000 of 7,000,000,000 (top 50%) (CIA Fact Book: 101:100)
* 5%: Geography: 350,000,000 of 7,000,000,000 (top 5%) (US Census Bureau)
* 0.5%: College: 70,000,000 of 7,000,000 (20% of US Citizens in 1990)
* ... [1.6% of college football players are drafted to the NFL](https://www.sportskeeda.com/nfl/what-percentage-college-football-players-make-nfl)
* ... a much smaller percentage are quaterbacks
* ... a an much smaller percentage ever play a regular season game, ever.
