Making Jell-O is easy. You boil a cup of water, dissolve a powder into it, the add cold water to create a supersaturated solution. Cool it further and the gelatin sets. No big whoop. A first grader can do this.

The trick comes in transferring it to the refrigerator. I usually poured it into its final container at the kitchen counter then carefully transferring it—sometimes losing some to sloshing. Often, part of the difficulty is that I get to the frig and realize I need three hands for this operation, despite several prior activities where I had the same realization.

Thinking about that tonight, however, gave me an insight into just how dumb I am. The problem isn't that I don't have enough hands, or that the liquid sloshes, or that the container is unsuitably shallow. These obstacles aren't part of *essentially contestable idea*—I've added these obstacles based on my own construction of the problem.

Instead, I can set the empty dish in the refrigerator and decant into it from a much more suitable container (a Pyrex, 2-cup measuring cup).
