2:41 get Job done
    3:10 resist procrastinating
    4:12 know you dont know
    4:46 iterate wildly
6:24 build a product
    7:36 no emotional investment in my code
    9:13 study the domain
    10:22 watch your users
13:04 solve for now
    14:58 learn to see what is really there
    17:43 solve the real problem
20:04 choose the right tool
    21:15 data outlives code and the organizations
    24:46 do the simplest thing, not the easiest
        26:44 make the change easy
            27:14
                27:30 replacable component architecture
                28:00 spike and stabilise
                28:56 reduce, reuse,  recycle
                29:53
31:02 be a polyglot
    31:09 explore languages, tools, paradigms
    33:29 be full-stack
    34:10 be really full-stack
