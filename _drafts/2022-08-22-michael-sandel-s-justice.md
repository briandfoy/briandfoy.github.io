Michael Sandel's *Justice* series from Harvard, as well as the quality of his audience, is quite disappointing. I think he knows the answers, but his Socratic Method of merely letting students speak their instanteous reactions does nothing to help them. This is a survey course on philosophy, and partly public policy, that helps no one. His audience is left with no more better tools on thinking than when they started.

But hey, it's Harvard, so the bar is very low.


## [The Moral Side of Murder](http://justiceharvard.org/themoralsideofmurder/) - The Trolley Problem

Sandel presents the trolley problem, and asks attendees why they chose one way or the other. He mentions Consequentialism, the idea that you are absolved if it turns out well, and Categorialism, the idea that you act according to the rules despite the outcome. That's a bit glib, to be sure, but it's because this is such a waste of time.

But the [Trolley Problem is Absurd](https://neal.fun/absurd-trolley-problems/). Play the game and see that the simple decision you thought you had is then upended in the next version of it.

Honestly, after hearing people gush about Sandel, I'm surprised this is so lightweight and inconsequential. I don't disagree with any of this points, but he has few points. I find it hard to believe that this half hour is so devoid of anything useful to students.

I'm not at all surprised at the vacuous student responses though. I'm not even surprised they had the confidence to stand up and say such stupid things for either side. And, these are foreseeable stupid things that people say, yet Sandel does not spring his traps once they fall into them.

But Sandel doesn't make a strong case for the entire point of the scenario. Do we have to do anything to help anyone else? I don't think the students realize that was the actual question.

The idea of Consequentialism is self-defeating. Who gets to decide if the outcome is worthy of the actions? How would we ever know if the action had a better outcome? But, he's merely laying the foundation for the next lecture. Maybe he'll have a point there.

## [2. The Case for Cannibalism](http://justiceharvard.org/lecture-2-the-case-for-cannibalism/) - The Lifeboat Problem

Sandel presents the case of The Queen versus Dudley and Stevens. In 1884, three men in the lifeboat killed another for food and liquid. Were they right? Does Jeremy Bentham's Utilitarianism allow this?

The problem with Utilitarianism is someone has to assign and add up the utility. People disagree on the assignments. Sandel knows this because he thinks markets are corrupting and exploitative, but this is absent from his lecture. He doesn't even broach the question, and no one brings it up.

Are the three people justified in killing the fourth because they think that they need to eat him to survive?

One question to ask here is what would you think if they were rescued that same day? Conversely, what if they never murdered the fourth and were never rescued?

How do they know they need to eat the fourth in order to survive? Aren't they merely reacting out of fear of an uncertain future? How long, for example, did Shackleton's failed expedition survive so long in worse conditions?

But those questions are red herrings. If we accept the idea that one group can decide what's in its best interests, are they allowed to act any way they choose?

Let's ask this slightly differently. Was Bernard Goetz justified in shooting four men on the New York City subway in 1984? Now the numbers are reversed. But, let's make it Goetz against one person. Goetz decides that to survive he has to kill one other person. One person decides, for whatever reason, that the death of another is beneficial.

Goetz had previously been the victim of strongarm robbery, and was the target again when he had an illegal gun on him. He knew he was being mugged, and his attackers later admitted it.

But, let's now take that a step removed from the situation. Goetz sees someone who might mug him, perhaps merely because of his race. Does the uncertain future and Goetz's personal estimate of the situation justify him pre-emptively killing someone so he is at less risk?

And, if Goetz isn't permitted to do that, why would three men in a lifeboat be able to make their decision based on things they don't know but still reasonably fear?


## [3. Putting a Price Tag on Life](http://justiceharvard.org/lecture-3-putting-a-price-tag-on-life/) - The Ford Pinto Case

Sandel presents the Ford Pinto case, where Ford declines to add an $11 part to several million cars because they'd pay out much less in damages for lawsuits. Student's react to this. Sandel comes close to teaching something, but not quite.

This is something on which Milton Friedman destroyed an earnest student. The arguments all beg the question that any other car is as safe as it can possibly be. No one brings up the idea that Ford was doing anything unusual here. If they decided to add the $11 part, what about some other seemingly inexpensive part that would have saved at least on life? It's not that there is a dollar figure attached to human life that is the interesting question. It's this: can we have anything at all if it is not perfect and is not completely risk free?

I almost thought Sandel had something when, at about 15:40 into the video, Anna brings up the idea of the protect of the minority (and the idea of factions from James Madison). He allows another student to make a stupid argument, and then he asks her to give an example of "utilitarianism violating the concern or respect due the minority". Anna falls back the the Lifeboat problem from the previous lecture, but the reply is obvious: the Holocaust. That was exactly the German majority thinking the utility to Aryans was greater than the millions of people they exterminated. And they were right on the grounds of utility. Oh, but contradiction! Checkmate.

But Sandel brings up the rather toothless example of Romans throwing Christians to the lions for entertainment, and if the Romans are happy enough, the murder's utility is justified.

This sort of mathematical thinking, looking at the extremes, quickly finds the absurdities.

## [4. Putting a Price Tag on Life](http://justiceharvard.org/lecture-4-how-to-measure-pleasure/) -

He's back on shaky ground, but he's starting to talk about the conflicts in values and perhaps their variable utility. He tells a story about a college administration disallowing male guests in female dorms because of the additional wear and tear and resource use, noting that this was a ruse to hide their true values. Their argument was defeated by the other side saying that male students would then pay 50p to compensate the college.

But then he takes this ruse at face value by then focusing on their translation to money. He says nothing about the fact that one side was lying. Somehow this ends up talking about "higher" and "lower" preferences, which is a tautology at this point because he's working so hard to avoid the question.

John Stuart Mill then shows up.

Sandel shows three movie clips: a *Hamlet* soliloquy, a *Fear Factor* commercial, and a *Simpsons* clip. Mill says it's enough that we like something to prove that we like something. Then we asks by applause what people found most entertaining, and there's very little participation. Still he ignores this rather than make the point that he almost made earlier: people do not tell you the truth about their preferences. Economists call this the difference between stated and revealed preferences.

## [5. Free to Choose]() - Bill Gates and Michael Jordan

This lecture is especially infuriating not only because Sandel deliberately misleads his audience, and not only because no one calls him on it, but that I also think that he simply does not understand the finance.

He uses wealth of Bill Gates and Michael Jordan to talk about libertarianism, wealth distribution, and the idea that taxes are literally slavery.

He says that Bill Gates earns $150 per hour. No one corrects him. It's not the amount that's wrong, but that Bill Gates "earns" anything. What does it mean to earn?

Sandel inappropriately pushes the Labor Theory of Value. His statements beg the question that the value of anything is the amount of labor that goes into it.

Bill Gates does not "earn" $150/hr. He doesn't really "earn" anything. He owns bits of paper that other people are willing to buy. I'd like to call these literal bits of paper, but hardly anyone owns actual stock certificates anymore.

These bits of paper have no value other than what people are willing to pay for them. They don't feed you, cloth you, or provide you shelter. You might be able to temporarily fix a hole in your shoe, block out some light in a window, or some other thing related to their physicality, but they are not uniquely valuable for those. A newspaper would do the same tasks.

This is a particularly important point. You can disagree with markets, as Sandel does, and that's fine. The finance around these things are inefficient and costly; there are winners and losers. Sandel (not in this lecture) points out the wrong headed notion that people deserve what happen to them, which he calls "meritocratic hubris". To be sure, some people lose, but some of those loses are easily foreseen and avoided. There are levels of risk, and when you don't have much, you shouldn't risk much. But, the government has its fingers on the scale, incentivizing bad behavior (student loans and the rising cost of college) and discentivizing good behavior (overregulation of business and barriers to entry).

The stock market is voluntary. Sandel thinks it's corrupt, and maybe so, but your pension fund isn't asking you what to do, but your participation is voluntary too up to the point that government regulation limits your own choices outside of the ones they allow (so, back to libertarianism!). As a small business owner, I'm quite aware that the government has their fingers on the scale. And, most of the market is not rich people merely because there are that many. It's the pooled investment of not-rich people, and those people don't participate. I'd wager that most people do not even know which companies they have invested in, mostly because they are invested in some limited number of funds their employer provides.

The interesting question is whether we should allow voluntary transactions and if people should be content with the consequences of their free choices. Should GameStop shorters have to pay the price when Apes fuck with the market just for laughs? Shorting has a genuine function in the marketplace as a valve for inflated value. Should the Apes suffer when the shorters reorganize? There's no winning in finance.

Sandel isn't a liberal, in that he does not believe in voluntary transactions unless they benefit the "community". This hearkens back to my earlier complaints about who gets to decide the value of something. By now, five lectures in, he should have said something about this, and he hasn't.

But he's wrapped himself in the idea that there is some external value that people must provide to the "community". But, what "community"? There are those groups with which we freely choose and continue to associate with, such as a church, sports team, and so on, but there are also those with which he have no freedom. There is practically no place on Earth that you can go where some government will leave you alone. The uncontacted tribes of Brazil might be the best counterpoint, but a government also prevents other people from going there.

This is a curious idea. Consider, for example, the treatment of First Nations people in North America, which at times has been genocidal. Yes, this includes Canada. Let's suppose that we treated First Nations people with dignity and respect in all manners. How would that have gone? Eventually they'd be ruled by the same government ruling everybody and their freedoms would be limited just as they are limited with everyone. They'd have to function within the community that's forced upon them, just like every other person who has had the government forced upon them. The difference is that they remember that at some time long ago they weren't so limited. Other people have either forgotten this, or remember a past where they were more limited.

And, what do we call the system where you are compelled to act in the interests of the collective even at expense to individual liberty?

We call that Fascism.

Well, about half the people call that Fascism. Some people have whitewashed the idea to call it Collectivism. Other people have redefined Fascism so it's not on their side of the political spectrum and they don't have to account for it. Sandel calls it "communtarianism" (well, Rawls did, and Sandel follows).


## [6. Who Owns Me?]() - John Locke and Private Property

Collective Goods, paternalism

fire insurance

Katrina

Raoul - you don't have to live in this society

The poor need the money more

Theft of bread

The rich owe a debt to society

woman says murder is self possession, Sandel does not fight back "You don't have self possession if you choose to live in a society"


## [7. This Land is My Land]() -

There's nothing much to say about this lecture because it's so slight, and the Harvard students are just as ignorant and uninformed. A black woman stands up to bring up European colonization of the Americas (because that's as far back as the 1619 Project wants her to think), and an Asian woman stands up to carry on the myth of the Noble Savage cooperating in common in all things everywhere all the time. That's an especially racist trope of "Eastern" cultures. These two people stood up, made racist comments, and Sandel tolerated that.

Sandel talks at length about private property without ever defining it. How do we get private property with no government? I don't quite understand why government is even involved in this discussion other than Locke thinking about it. He talks about Natural Rights, but we haven't establish those actually exist.

Private property is basically that held to the exclusion of others. This is why you can't own property on the Moon. You can't exclude others without being there. If you think of yourself as your own property, you can exclude others.

Well, you can't really exclude others because the government doesn't let you defend yourself or decline to participate. Most governments take away people's ability to act in self defenses but removing and criminalizing tools of defense.

Along those lines (and outside of this lecture), Sandel has this weird idea that your particular economic condition is the government's fault and, from that shaky connection, calls anything you do because of that condition "coercion". You're poor so you join the military. The US has a completely volunteer military. It's even worse—people who want to get in can't always join. When lots of people want in, the disqualifying conditions, such as visibile tattoos, increase. When few people want to join, those are relaxed.

Lastly, there's this weird idea that there are no property rights on Indian reservations today, but that ignores the definition of "reservation". That land is set aside for one group and excludes other groups. Can another tribe move into the Creek reservation, and if so, why not? Drive through one of these if you have the chance, but bring your own food and water. Most of it is fallow and deserted. Why is that?

American First Nations certainly thought about property rights. They fought with each other. They excluded others. Indeed, Steven Pinker (*A History of Violence*) notes that "pre-state" societies are much more violent, despite the long list of distinguished people lining up on the side of the virtuous *Homo Sapiens*.

Henry Kissinger notes that the only reason we have peace now is that we have enforced boundaries. On one side of the border you can be Catholic, and on the other side, Protestant. There is now largely peace in former Yugoslavia because there are borders. Not for nothing, but Africa hasn't finished re-organizing itself and hasn't settled into this homeostasis. Neither has post-Soviet eastern Europe.

## [8. Consenting Adults]() - John Locke and Consent

At the start of this lecture, Sandel acknowledges, but does not emphasize, that people already agree with Locke even if they don't. The idea of "consent" has been fundamental in almost every student comment so far.
