I've been refining my daily dose of information.

## Aggregate, Aggregate, Aggregate

Lately when I think of my RSS reader (the no longer supported NetNewsWire)- no, wait a minute! Checking my sources like a good writer I see that <A href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/netnewswire-review-the-mac-rss-client-rebooted-with-a-solid-foundation-for-the-future/">NetNewsWire 5</a> came out a couple of months ago! This is about
a year after <a href="https://medium.com/bpxl-craft/the-future-of-netnewswire-8fc999387a8a">Black Rock officially gave up</a> after years
of stagnation.

Back to the story.

I try to collect everything I want to read into my RSS Aggregator. Tech, News, whatever. I even have a program that turns some Twitter
feeds into RSS. I go to one place for all of this.

## Don't read everything right away

I don't read most of the stuff I aggregate though. I skim and filter.
Some things end up in Safari's Reading List, and some things end up
in Reminders.

In the Digitacene, we've lost an important and serendipitous way
of educating ourselves. The direct access to information means that
we hardly ever have to scan and filter. That's an important process
for context and discovery though.

How many kids today have to pull out a paper dictionary to look up a
word? Surely much fewer than it used to be. I can directly look up a word by simply googling it (so not even a dictionary app).

It's the same with what I decide to read. How did I select those things? I scanned lists of of what's out there and chose the ones
interesting to me. That's much different that taking a single link
from a social media post.


## Fill in gap time

Now that I have a list of things I know I want to read, I can go back
to it on the subway or on a plane. Or, even when I'm looking for something to do. Instead of reading things right away and taking up
a bunch of time that I could use more wisely, I essentially get this time back for free when I'd be wasting it anyway.
