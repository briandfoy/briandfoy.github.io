I despised one of the scientists I was forced to work with in graduate
school. He was a bad manager, an unorganized scientists, a poor teacher, and extremely
full of himself. He was practically forced out of a national lab for
being a lightweight.

So I decided to assist in triggering a heart attack. It never happened
though.

I didn't do anything special or covert. I knew that he needed to work
on his cholesterol, so I presented the opportunity for him to make it
worse.

One morning, I stopped by Dunkin' Donuts on my way into the lab. I
brought in a dozen doughnuts and left them in the break room. I think he
had two.

At the end of the day, I found five dollars and change in the box. The
other scientists must have chipped in when they took something. That checks
out; they were stand-up guys. The target scientist, however, who knows.
He did ask that I bring in muffins instead the next day.

Bitch, please.

I brought in doughnuts again the next day, using the money everyone
else had thrown in. Same result: five bucks at the end of the day.

The next day I brought in pizza and I left it in my office, although
you could smell it throughout the wing. The target asked for a couple
of slices. Sure, have some of this greasy pizza.

After that, I'd do it again every so often, and he could never control
himself. Fuck him.

The guy kept living, but I decided to leave grad school and never had
to deal with him again. Some people were surprised but some of the
other scientists weren't.
