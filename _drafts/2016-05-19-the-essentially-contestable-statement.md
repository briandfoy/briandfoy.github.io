https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentially_contested_concept

Clarke argued that to state that a concept is merely "contested" is to "attribute significance to the contest rather than to the concept". Yet, to state that a concept is "contestable" (rather than "merely contested") is to "attribute some part of any contest to the concept"; namely, "to claim that some feature or property of the concept makes it polysemantic, and that [from this] the concept contains some internal conflict of ideas"; and it's this state of affairs that provides the "essentially contestable concept" with its "inherent potential [for] generating disputes".[16]

 'essential' refers to the location of the disagreement or indeterminacy; it is contestation at the core, not just at the borderlines or penumbra of a concept"

It's what leads Sherlock Holmes to be wrong so often. He's consistently adding his priors to his contextless, <i>thin descriptions</i> of the world. Well, Watson is the one actually telling us these things, so there's a fictional character describing what some other fictional character is doing, so there's another layer of interpretation. Peter Holmes (a real-life comic, no relation) rightly satirizes a scene from the BBC's <i>Sherlock</i> that was the actually the last scene I saw because it was so ludicrous.

You might like <a href="https://amzn.to/3belDFE">Sherlock Holmes was Wrong</a>, although you should know that it was written by a Frenchmanâ€”they tend to approach problems in a way that an American like me finds tedious when it's actually just different.
