* [Best Practices for Scientific Computing](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745)
* [Guidelines for authors submitting code & software](https://www.nature.com/documents/GuidelinesCodePublication.pdf)


What is a best practice?

	* You get behavior you want
	* You exclude behavior you don't want
	* What you want isn't what someone else wants
	* We talk about general problems and general solutions
	* But programming is about decomposition and specificity
	* Economic utility
		* Time zone bug - happens one a year, just restart
	* We don't teach people how to make decisions
	* what are the consequences (and their severities?)
