In [Mastering Perl](https://www.masteringperl.org), I use a factorial example to show benchmarking. I don't particularly care about the code, but I wanted something I know I could make slower. It's an example that many writers use because it's clean, and, honestly, it's what we've all seen when we read about recursion.
