Most of my writing is about Perl, my books about Perl, and then some Perl. My Twitter handle, [@briandfoy_perl](https://www.twitter.com/briandfoy_perl), even has that in it. I did write a book about a different language, but that was Perl 6 (now Raku). Lately there's been quite a bit I could have shared with the world, so now there's this.

My other writing tends to be detailed and thorough. That's time consumingâ€”the seemingly simplest of posts can take a day or more of research to explore and test corner cases and so on. I don't strive for that level of detail here. I'll do something and say what I did. Maybe it's wrong, inefficient, or otherwise wrongheaded. But I can fix that stuff.

All of this is in [GitHub](https://github.com/briandfoy/briandfoy.github.io), so you can file issues and pull requests, I guess.
